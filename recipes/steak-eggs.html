    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Enjoy the rustic taste of the original steak and eggs with this recipe. A nicely cooked steak coupled with a pair of eggs can never go wrong.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Steak</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
            <li>Red wine vinegar</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
           <li><strong>Prep the Steak:</strong> Take the steak out of the fridge, and pat it dry with paper towels. Sprinkle it generously with salt and pepper, and set it aside for 20 to 30 minutes. You can cover it with a clean tea towel, paper towels, or a plate.</li>
           <li><strong>Cook the Steak.</strong> Melt the butter and heat the oil together in a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Place the steak in the hot skillet, and cook for about 3 to 4 minutes per side, or until browned.</li> 
           <li><strong>Add the Eggs to the Skillet. </strong>Push the steak to the side of the skillet, and reduce the heat to medium-low. When the skillet is less hot, add the eggs, being careful not to break the yolks. Season the eggs with salt and pepper.</li>
           <li><strong>Cover and Cook.</strong> When the whites of the eggs start to set, cover the skillet with a lid and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the eggs are done. At this point, the steak’s internal temperature should register between 130˚F and 135˚F.</li>
           <li><strong>Finish the Dish</strong> Turn off the skillet. Take the steak out of the skillet, and place it on a cutting board. Allow it to stand for about five minutes before cutting and serving. Meanwhile, combine the sauce ingredients in a blender and pulse until thoroughly combined.</li>
           <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong> Serve the steak and eggs warm with the freshly made sauce.</li>
